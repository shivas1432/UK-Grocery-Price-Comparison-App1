### Data Management

#### Mock Data System
- **Realistic price data** with daily variations and seasonal trends
- **Store-specific pricing models** reflecting real-world price differences
- **Promotional system** with percentage, fixed, and BOGO offers
- **Inventory management** with stock levels and availability tracking

#### Type Safety
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: ProductCategory;
  stores: StorePrice[];
  priceHistory: PriceHistoryEntry[];
  // ... additional properties
}
```
